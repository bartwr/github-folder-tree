# GitHub Folder Tree üå≤

**github-folder-tree** is a React custom hook that allows you to fetch and process the contents of a GitHub folder. It retrieves information about the files and subfolders in the specified folder, including their names, file types, download URLs, SHA hashes, sizes, and paths. In addition, it provides the functionality to download the contents of the folder as a ZIP file and access repository information.

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

To install `github-folder-tree`, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install github-folder-tree

# or

yarn add github-folder-tree
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To use `github-folder-tree`, import it into your React component:

```javascript
import {useGitHubFolderTree} from 'github-folder-tree';
```

**repositoryUrl** is the URL of the GitHub repository, and **apiKey** is an optional GitHub API key for authentication.

```jsx
const { repoFiles, error, log, fetchRepositoryContents, useGitHubFolderDownload, repoInfo } = useGitHubFolderTree(folderUrl, apiKey);
```

### Example

```javascript
import React, { FC, useState } from 'react';
import useGitHubFolderTree from './hooks/useGitHubFolderTree';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [folderUrl, setFolderUrl] = useState('');
  const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState('');
  const { repoFiles, error, log, fetchRepositoryContents, useGitHubFolderDownload, repoInfo } = useGitHubFolderTree(folderUrl, apiKey);

  const handleFetchClick = () => {
    fetchRepositoryContents();
  };

  const handleDownloadClick = () => {
    useGitHubFolderDownload();
  };

  if (repoFiles.length > 0) {
    console.log(repoFiles);
    console.log(repoInfo);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={folderUrl} onChange={(e) => setFolderUrl(e.target.value)} placeholder="Enter GitHub folder URL" />
      <input type="text" value={apiKey} onChange={(e) => setApiKey(e.target.value)} placeholder="Enter GitHub API key (optional)" />
      <button onClick={handleFetchClick}>Fetch Folder Contents</button>
      <button onClick={handleDownloadClick}>Download Folder as ZIP</button>
      {error && <div>Error: {error}</div>}
      {log && <div>Log: {log}</div>}
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Size</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {repoFiles.map((file) => (
            <tr key={file.download_url}>
              <td>
                <a href={file.download_url}>{file.name}</a>
              </td>
              <td>{file.file_type}</td>
              <td>{file.size}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In the above example, **folderUrl** is the URL of the GitHub folder, and **apiKey** is an optional GitHub API key for authentication.

To fetch the contents of a GitHub folder, enter the folder URL in the input field and click **Fetch Folder Contents**. The files and their details will be displayed in a table. Any errors or log messages will be shown accordingly.

To download the folder as a ZIP file, click the **Download Folder as ZIP** button. The ZIP file will be generated and downloaded.

To fetch the contents of the root folder of a repository, use the repository URL in the following format:

```bash
https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/tree/{branch}
```

For example:

```bash
https://github.com/sauravhathi/lpu-cse/tree/master
```

To fetch the contents of a specific directory or folder within the repository, append the directory path to the repository URL:

```bash
https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/tree/{branch}/{dir}
```

For example:

```bash
https://github.com/sauravhathi/lpu-cse/tree/master/Subjects
```

Note: Make sure to handle any errors and display them appropriately in your React component.
